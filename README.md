# Tutorial_Python

This repository aims at introducing the basics of Python and of a few useful packages for scientific computing.

The tutorials are given in the form of Jupyter notebooks and supports Python 2 and Python 3.
To use Jupyter notebooks, install the Anaconda distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) and refer to
the first notebook (**Python_X/Introduction_Jupyter_Notebooks.ipynb**).

The content of the other notebooks is quickly described below:

- **Tutorial_Python.ipynb** -> an introduction to Python built-in types (mainly numbers, booleans, lists and dictionaries), commands
and syntax (how to use functions, conditionnal statements, loops...).

- **Numpy.ipynb** -> an introduction to Numpy, a Python package for multi-dimensionnal array manipulation.

- **Matplotlib.ipynb** -> an introduction to Matplotlib, a plotting library providing a Matlab-like interface for data visualization.

- **Scipy.ipynb** -> an illustration of the Scipy library on curve-fitting tasks.
